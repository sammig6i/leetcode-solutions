### High Priority (Highest ROI):
- DFS (Depth-First Search) - A fundamental search technique for tree and graph problems. Solves many interview questions.
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) - Another key search strategy for graphs and trees. Essential for shortest-path problems.
- Two Pointers - A common pattern for array-related problems (e.g., finding pairs, subarrays, etc.).
- Sliding Window - High ROI and often used for substring, subarray, and optimization problems.
- Sorting - Core pattern used in a variety of problems involving arrays, intervals, etc.
- Binary Search - Often used for searching in sorted arrays, important for optimization.

### Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAs):
- Arrays - Fundamental and appears in most coding problems.
- In-place Reversal of a Linked List - A classic pattern for linked list manipulation, commonly asked in interviews.
- Graph - Start with DFS/BFS and expand as needed to more complex graph algorithms (e.g., topological sort).
- Backtracking - Highly useful for combinatorial problems like generating permutations or solving puzzles (e.g., Sudoku).
- Fast & Slow Pointers - This technique is essential for detecting cycles in linked lists and finding the middle of the list.

### Medium Priority (Medium ROI):
- Dynamic Programming - More advanced but essential for optimization problems. Classic problems include knapsack, house robber, etc.
- Greedy - Medium ROI but useful for interval problems or problems where local choices lead to a global solution.
- Intervals - Often combined with sorting and greedy techniques.
- Union Find - Useful in problems involving disjoint sets, often used in graph-related problems.
- Trie - Important for string and prefix problems, especially autocomplete features.

### Secondary Priority (Low ROI or Rare):
- Design - More relevant for system design interviews than algorithmic coding.
- QuickSelect - Less common but useful for selection problems, such as finding the k-th smallest/largest element.
- Bit Manipulation - Appears in some problems but not as frequently as others.
- Topological Sort - Useful but appears less frequently. Mostly used in scheduling and graph problems.
- Bucket Sort - Rarely directly asked but related to sorting and partitioning techniques.

### Low Priority (Very Rare in Interviews):
- Heap - Medium ROI but not as common as other basic DSAs. Used in priority queue and top-k problems.

### Summary:
1. Start with DFS, BFS, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and basic DSAs like Arrays, Sorting, and Binary Search.
2. Then move to Backtracking, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming.
